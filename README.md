## How to Study

### 1. Read the Challenge
Each file starts with:
- Problem requirements
- Your specific tasks
- Interview focus points
- Key concepts to understand

### 2. Implement Step by Step
Start with basic functionality, then add:
- Error handling
- Thread safety
- Performance optimizations
- Monitoring/metrics

### 3. Run Tests Frequently
```bash
# Run tests as you implement
pytest day1/test_rate_limiter.py::TestSlidingWindowRateLimiter::test_basic_rate_limiting -v
```

### 4. Review and Optimize
- Study the test cases to understand edge cases
- Optimize for the performance benchmarks
- Practice explaining your design choices

## Interview Tips

### What They're Looking For
‚úÖ **Clean, readable code**  
‚úÖ **Proper error handling**  
‚úÖ **Thread safety awareness**  
‚úÖ **Scalability considerations**  
‚úÖ **Clear communication**  

### Red Flags to Avoid
‚ùå Silent coding (think out loud!)  
‚ùå Ignoring edge cases  
‚ùå Over-engineering simple problems  
‚ùå No consideration for concurrency  
‚ùå Can't explain your code  

### Time Management (50 min coding + 10 min discussion)
- **0-5 min**: Clarify requirements, discuss scale
- **5-35 min**: Core implementation, focus on correctness
- **35-45 min**: Add optimizations, handle edge cases
- **45-50 min**: Walk through test cases, discuss issues
- **50-60 min**: Code review discussion, explain trade-offs

## Common Questions by Challenge

### Rate Limiter
- "How would you implement rate limiting for our API?"
- "What's the difference between sliding window and token bucket?"
- "How do you handle distributed rate limiting?"

### LRU Cache
- "Implement a cache that expires old entries"
- "How do you make this thread-safe?"
- "What's the time complexity of your operations?"

### Producer-Consumer
- "Design a system to process background jobs"
- "How do you handle backpressure?"
- "What happens if a consumer crashes?"

### Job Queue
- "Build a task scheduling system"
- "How do you handle job retries?"
- "How do you ensure jobs don't get lost?"

### Distributed Hash Table
- "Design a key-value store that scales horizontally"
- "How do you handle node failures?"
- "Explain consistent hashing"

## Implementation Strategy

### Start Simple, Then Enhance
1. **Basic working solution** - Get core functionality right
2. **Error handling** - Handle failure cases gracefully  
3. **Thread safety** - Add proper synchronization
4. **Performance** - Optimize for scale
5. **Monitoring** - Add metrics and observability

### Key Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating different implementations
- **Strategy Pattern**: For different algorithms (hashing, retry, etc.)
- **Observer Pattern**: For monitoring and metrics
- **Command Pattern**: For job processing
- **State Pattern**: For managing component lifecycle

## Testing Your Implementation

### Unit Tests
Each challenge has comprehensive test suites covering:
- Basic functionality
- Edge cases
- Thread safety
- Performance
- Error conditions

### Integration Tests
- Cross-component interactions
- Failure scenarios
- Performance under load

### Performance Benchmarks
- Throughput measurements
- Latency percentiles
- Memory usage
- Concurrent access patterns

## Real Interview Examples

### Example 1: Rate Limiter
**Interviewer**: "Our API is getting hammered. Design a rate limiter."

**Your approach**:
1. Clarify: Per-user? Per-IP? What limits?
2. Choose algorithm: Token bucket for bursts, sliding window for smooth rate
3. Implement basic version
4. Add Redis for distributed case
5. Handle edge cases: clock skew, cleanup

### Example 2: Background Jobs
**Interviewer**: "We need to process user uploads in the background."

**Your approach**:
1. Clarify: Job types? Priorities? Failure handling?
2. Design: Producer adds jobs, workers process them
3. Implement: Priority queue, worker pool, retry logic
4. Scale: Multiple workers, job persistence
5. Monitor: Job status, worker health, queue depth
