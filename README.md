## 📚 How to Study Each Problem

### 1. Read the Problem README
Each problem has a detailed README with:
- **Visual Architecture** - Mermaid diagrams showing system design
- **Key Concepts** - Deep dive into algorithms and patterns
- **Real-World Applications** - How it's used in production
- **Interview Discussion Points** - Common questions and answers
- **Implementation Guide** - Step-by-step approach

### 2. Implement Step by Step
```python
# Start with TODOs in the boilerplate code
# Example from rate_limiter.py:
class SlidingWindowRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_requests: int, window_size_seconds: int):
        pass  # TODO: Implement
    
    def is_allowed(self, key: str) -> RateLimitResult:
        pass  # TODO: Implement
```

### 3. Run Tests Frequently
```bash
# Run specific test as you implement
pytest day-1/problem-1-rate-limiter/test_rate_limiter.py::TestSlidingWindowRateLimiter::test_basic_rate_limiting -v

# Run all tests for the problem
pytest day-1/problem-1-rate-limiter/ -v
```

### 4. Study the Test Cases
Tests show you:
- Edge cases to handle
- Performance requirements
- Thread safety expectations
- Real-world usage patterns

## 🎤 Interview Preparation Strategy

### What Interviewers Look For
✅ **Problem-solving process** - Think out loud  
✅ **Clean, readable code** - Well-structured implementation  
✅ **Edge case handling** - Robust error handling  
✅ **Scalability awareness** - Performance considerations  
✅ **Communication skills** - Explain trade-offs clearly  

### Time Management (60-minute interview)
- **0-5 min**: Clarify requirements and constraints
- **5-10 min**: Design high-level architecture
- **10-40 min**: Core implementation
- **40-50 min**: Handle edge cases and optimizations
- **50-60 min**: Discuss trade-offs and scaling

### Red Flags to Avoid
❌ Silent coding without explanation  
❌ Jumping to code without understanding requirements  
❌ Ignoring edge cases and error handling  
❌ No consideration for thread safety or performance  
❌ Unable to explain design decisions  

## 🗣️ Common Interview Questions by Problem

### Rate Limiter
- "Design rate limiting for our API that handles 1M requests/second"
- "How would you implement distributed rate limiting across multiple servers?"
- "What's the difference between sliding window and token bucket algorithms?"

### LRU Cache
- "Implement a cache that automatically expires old entries"
- "How do you make your cache thread-safe without hurting performance?"
- "Design a multi-level cache system (L1: memory, L2: Redis, L3: database)"

### Producer-Consumer
- "Design a system to process background jobs with priorities"
- "How do you handle backpressure when producers are faster than consumers?"
- "What happens when a consumer crashes while processing a job?"

### Job Queue
- "Build a task scheduling system that can handle millions of jobs"
- "How do you ensure no jobs are lost if a worker crashes?"
- "Design retry logic for failed jobs with exponential backoff"

### Distributed Hash Table
- "Design a key-value store that can scale horizontally"
- "How do you handle node failures in a distributed system?"
- "Explain how consistent hashing works and why it's important"

### Event Streaming
- "Design a real-time analytics pipeline for user events"
- "How do you ensure message ordering in a distributed streaming system?"
- "What are the trade-offs between throughput and latency in event processing?"

## 🏗️ Implementation Patterns

### Start Simple, Build Complexity
1. **Basic functionality** - Get core logic working
2. **Error handling** - Handle failure cases gracefully
3. **Thread safety** - Add proper synchronization
4. **Performance** - Optimize for scale
5. **Monitoring** - Add metrics and observability

### Design Patterns Used
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating different algorithm implementations
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable algorithms (hashing, retry strategies)
- **Observer Pattern**: Monitoring and metrics collection
- **Command Pattern**: Job processing and queuing
- **State Pattern**: Managing component lifecycle

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

### Testing Pyramid
```
     /\     E2E Tests
    /  \    Integration Tests
   /____\   Unit Tests (largest)
```

Each problem includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Throughput and latency
- **Concurrency Tests**: Thread safety verification
- **Chaos Tests**: Failure scenario handling

## 🎯 Real Interview Success Stories

### Example Flow: Rate Limiter Question

**Interviewer**: "Our API is getting hammered by bots. Design a rate limiter."

**Your approach**:
1. **Clarify**: "Should we limit per-user, per-IP, or both? What's the expected traffic volume?"
2. **Design**: "I'll use token bucket for burst traffic and sliding window for smooth rates"
3. **Implement**: Start with basic algorithm, add thread safety
4. **Scale**: "For distributed systems, we can use Redis with Lua scripts"
5. **Monitor**: "We need metrics for rate limit hits and false positives"

**Key**: You demonstrate systematic thinking, technical depth, and production awareness.

## 📈 Success Metrics
