PROBLEM: Money/Decimal Handler (15-20 minutes)

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Payment systems must handle money with perfect precision. Floating point 
arithmetic causes rounding errors that can lose or create money.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a Money class that handles decimal arithmetic precisely
2. Support different currencies (USD, EUR, etc.)
3. Implement basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
4. Handle currency conversion with exchange rates
5. Proper rounding rules for different currencies

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How do you handle currency conversion precision?
- What happens when you divide money that doesn't split evenly?
- How do you prevent money from being lost due to rounding?
- How would you handle different currency decimal places (JPY has 0, USD has 2)?
