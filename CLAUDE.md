## Interview Format Breakdown

**‚è∞ 50 minutes coding + 10 minutes discussion**

**Minutes 1-5:** Problem clarification
- Ask about scale (users, requests/sec)
- Clarify requirements and constraints
- Discuss edge cases

**Minutes 5-35:** Core implementation
- Start with basic working solution
- Focus on correctness first
- Handle main use cases

**Minutes 35-45:** Optimization & edge cases
- Add thread safety if needed
- Handle error conditions
- Optimize for performance

**Minutes 45-50:** Testing & validation
- Walk through test cases
- Discuss potential issues
- Suggest monitoring approaches

**Minutes 50-60:** Code review discussion
- Explain design decisions
- Discuss trade-offs
- Talk about production considerations

## Study Strategy (3-Day Plan)

**Day 1: Master the Big 3**
- Rate limiter (sliding window + token bucket)
- LRU cache with TTL
- Thread-safe producer-consumer

**Day 2: Build Complexity**
- Background job queue with priorities
- Distributed hash table basics
- Circuit breaker pattern

**Day 3: Advanced Patterns**
- Consistent hashing
- Event streaming
- Mock interview practice

## Key Technologies to Understand

**Data Structures You'll Use:**
- HashMap/Dictionary (O(1) lookups)
- Deque (sliding windows)
- Priority Queue (job scheduling)
- Linked Lists (LRU cache)
- Trees (range queries)

**Concurrency Primitives:**
- Locks/Mutexes
- Semaphores
- Condition variables
- Atomic operations
- Thread pools

**Common Algorithms:**
- Consistent hashing
- Token bucket
- Exponential backoff
- Binary search variants
- Graph traversal (for dependency resolution)

## Success Patterns

**Always Start With:**
1. Clarify requirements
2. Design basic data structures
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add error handling
5. Optimize for scale

**They Want to See:**
- Clean, readable code
- Proper error handling
- Understanding of trade-offs
- Scalability considerations
- Thread safety awareness

**Instant Red Flags:**
- Silent coding (no communication)
- Ignoring edge cases
- Over-engineering simple problems
- No consideration for concurrency
- Unable to explain your code

## Practice Resources

**Implementation Focus:**
- Each question should take 20-25 minutes
- Code in your preferred language
- Focus on working solutions first
- Then optimize and handle edge cases

**Mock Interview Topics:**
- "Design a rate limiter for our API"
- "Implement a cache that expires old entries"
- "Build a background job processing system"
- "Create a connection pool for database access"
- "Design a URL shortener's core logic"

Remember: They care more about your problem-solving process and code quality than perfect algorithmic knowledge. Think out loud, write clean code, and handle edge cases!
