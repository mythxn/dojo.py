# Background Job Processing System

## 🎯 Problem Overview

A robust job processing system is the backbone of modern scalable applications. It handles background tasks, manages priorities, implements retry logic, and ensures no work is lost. This challenge tests your ability to design fault-tolerant distributed systems.

## 🎨 Visual Architecture

### Job Processing Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Job Submitted] --> B[Job Queue<br/>Priority Based]
    B --> C[Worker Pool]
    C --> D{Job Success?}
    
    D -->|Success| E[Mark Completed]
    D -->|Failure| F{Retries Left?}
    
    F -->|Yes| G[Calculate Backoff Delay]
    F -->|No| H[Mark Failed]
    
    G --> I[Schedule Retry]
    I --> B
    
    E --> J[Update Statistics]
    H --> K[Dead Letter Queue]
    
    subgraph "Monitoring"
    L[Job Status Tracking]
    M[Worker Health Monitoring]
    N[Queue Depth Metrics]
    end
```

### Job Lifecycle States
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Running : Worker picks up
    Running --> Completed : Success
    Running --> Retrying : Failure + retries left
    Running --> Failed : Failure + no retries
    Retrying --> Running : Retry attempt
    Completed --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
    
    Pending --> Cancelled : Manual cancellation
    Running --> Cancelled : Manual cancellation
    Cancelled --> [*]
    
    note right of Retrying : Exponential backoff delay
    note right of Failed : Moved to dead letter queue
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Priority Queue with Job Scheduling
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Job Priority Queue"
    A[🔴 Critical: Priority 0<br/>System alerts, payments]
    B[🟠 High: Priority 1-3<br/>User requests, notifications]
    C[🟡 Normal: Priority 4-6<br/>Data processing, reports]
    D[🟢 Low: Priority 7-10<br/>Cleanup, analytics]
    end
    
    E[Worker Pool] --> A
    A --> F[Next Available Worker]
    E --> B
    E --> C
    E --> D
    
    G[Scheduler] --> H[Check Delayed Jobs]
    H --> I{Ready to Run?}
    I -->|Yes| B
    I -->|No| J[Keep in Schedule]
```

### Retry Strategies
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Job Failed] --> B{Retry Strategy}
    
    B --> C[Exponential Backoff<br/>delay = base * 2^attempt]
    B --> D[Linear Backoff<br/>delay = base * attempt]
    B --> E[Fixed Delay<br/>delay = constant]
    B --> F[No Retry<br/>immediate failure]
    
    C --> G[Wait 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...]
    D --> H[Wait 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s...]
    E --> I[Wait 5s, 5s, 5s, 5s...]
    
    G --> J[Retry Job]
    H --> J
    I --> J
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Worker Pool Management
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Job Queue System] --> B[Worker Manager]
    B --> C[Worker Pool]
    
    C --> D[Worker 1<br/>Status: Busy<br/>Current: email_job_123]
    C --> E[Worker 2<br/>Status: Idle<br/>Current: none]
    C --> F[Worker 3<br/>Status: Failed<br/>Current: none]
    C --> G[Worker N<br/>Status: Idle<br/>Current: none]
    
    H[Health Monitor] --> C
    H --> I{Worker Health Check}
    I -->|Healthy| J[Continue Working]
    I -->|Failed| K[Restart Worker]
    I -->|Overloaded| L[Scale Up Workers]
    
    M[Auto Scaler] --> N{Queue Depth}
    N -->|High| O[Add Workers]
    N -->|Low| P[Remove Workers]
```

### Job Persistence and Recovery
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant JobQueue
    participant Database
    participant Worker
    participant RetryScheduler
    
    Client->>JobQueue: Submit Job
    JobQueue->>Database: Persist Job (PENDING)
    JobQueue-->>Client: Job ID
    
    Worker->>JobQueue: Poll for Job
    JobQueue->>Database: Update Status (RUNNING)
    JobQueue-->>Worker: Job Details
    
    Worker->>Worker: Execute Job
    alt Job Success
        Worker->>Database: Update Status (COMPLETED)
        Worker-->>JobQueue: Success
    else Job Failure
        Worker->>Database: Update Status (RETRYING)
        Worker->>RetryScheduler: Schedule Retry
        RetryScheduler-->>JobQueue: Add to Delayed Queue
    end
```

**Q: "How do you handle job dependencies?"**
```python
# Job Dependency Graph
class JobDependency:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dependencies = {}  # job_id -> [prerequisite_job_ids]
        self.dependents = {}    # job_id -> [dependent_job_ids]
    
    def add_dependency(self, job_id, prerequisite_id):
        # Job can only run after prerequisite completes
        pass
    
    def job_completed(self, job_id):
        # Check if any dependent jobs can now run
        pass
```

**Q: "How do you scale the system?"**
| Scaling Dimension | Strategy | Implementation |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Horizontal** | More worker nodes | Container orchestration |
| **Vertical** | Bigger machines | Resource allocation |
| **Queue Partitioning** | Shard by job type | Multiple queue instances |
| **Database** | Read replicas | Query optimization |
