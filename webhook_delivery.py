"""
PROBLEM: Webhook Delivery System (20-25 minutes)

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Your payment platform needs to notify merchants when payments complete.
Webhooks must be delivered reliably even if merchant servers are down.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Deliver webhooks with exponential backoff retry
2. Track delivery attempts and success/failure
3. Handle timeouts and network errors gracefully
4. Support webhook signing for security
5. Queue webhooks for batch processing

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How do you handle webhooks that never succeed?
- What if a merchant's endpoint is temporarily down?
- How do you prevent duplicate webhook deliveries?
- How do you scale webhook delivery across multiple workers?
